            Hello @{}! Thank you for your contribution üí™
            As it's your first contribution be sure to test on different environments, different database structures and make sure your code follows good [Python practices](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and the [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/).
            If you have any design or process questions then you can ask in the [RagCP discussions](https://github.com/Freyja-Folkvangr/ragpycp/discussions).
